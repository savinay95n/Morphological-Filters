# Morphological-Filters

The Objective of this project is two-fold. The objective of the first part is to implement and iteratively observe the effect of multiple non-linear filters on a given image. In this project we implement the following five filters: Mean, Median, Alpha-trimmed, Sigma and Symmetrical Nearest Neighbor Mean. For every filter, we qualitatively and quantitatively observe how effectively it can remove added noise in the image using histograms. The goal is to observe how the histograms of filtered images clearly show discrete boundaries indicating the reduction of noise levels in gray scale images. The objective of the second part is to understand and implement the process of anisotropic diffusion of an image so as to remove noise within the image. The process involves computing gradients, conduction coefficients and histograms of an image. We get to learn how the number of iterations, the function of “g” and the value of “k” within “g” effect the final result of anisotropic diffusion. The goal is to gain a better understanding of these underlying concepts and reconstruct a better (less noisy) version of the uncorrupted image from a corrupted (noisy) image.
